# Geometry Shapes Project in C++

A student project to implement and test geometric shapes (Circle, Square, Triangle) using C++ and CTurtle for visualization.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Shapes**: 
  - **Circle**: Calculate circumference, area, translate, resize, and compare equality.
  - **Square**: Calculate perimeter, area, translate, resize, and compare equality.
  - **Triangle**: Calculate perimeter, area, translate, resize, and compare equality.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Draw shapes using CTurtle.
- **Tests**: Pre-written tests to validate implementations (e.g., `testSquare.cpp`).

---

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Compiler**: `g++` with C++23 support.
- **Libraries**: 
  - [CTurtle](https://github.com/walkerje/Cturtle) (for graphical output).
  - [CImg](http://cimg.eu/) (included via `CImg.hpp`).
- **OS**: Tested on Windows (requires `gdi32` and `user32` libraries).
